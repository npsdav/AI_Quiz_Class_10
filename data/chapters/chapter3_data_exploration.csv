A pie chart is best used for?,Time series|Proportions of categories|Correlation|Distributions,1,Pie charts show proportions among categories.
Which technique reduces the effect of different scales?,Encoding|Standardization|Visualization|Sampling,1,"Standardization scales features to mean 0, variance 1."
Normalization commonly rescales values to which range?,-1 to 1|0 to 1|0 to 10|1 to 100,1,Min-max normalization maps data between 0 and 1.
Which step helps detect duplicate records?,Model training|Data exploration|Deployment|Feature engineering,1,Exploration includes checking duplicates to ensure quality.
"Which diagram shows minimum, Q1, median, Q3, and maximum?",Histogram|Box plot|Scatter plot|Bar chart,1,Box plots summarize distribution with five-number summary.
"If correlation is close to 0, it means?",Strong linear relation|No linear relation|Perfect relation|Causation,1,Near-zero correlation suggests weak/no linear relation.
Which approach helps understand time trends?,Pie chart|Line chart|Bar chart|Box plot,1,Line charts show changes over time.
What does a scatter plot point represent?,A category|A single data record with two values|An average|A frequency bin,1,"Each point corresponds to paired values (x,y)."
Which term refers to converting text labels into numbers?,Visualization|Encoding|Scaling|Sampling,1,Encoding maps categories to numeric codes.
Which summary is NOT part of the five-number summary?,Minimum|Median|Mean|Maximum,2,"Five-number summary uses min, Q1, median, Q3, max (not mean)."
Which plot quickly shows frequency of categories like grades?,Box plot|Bar chart|Scatter plot|Histogram,1,Bar charts show category frequencies.
What is a data dictionary?,A list of model results|Documentation of fields and meanings|An algorithm|A chart type,1,"It describes variables, types, and allowed values."
What is the range of a dataset?,Mean value|Difference between max and min|Median value|Sum of values,1,Range measures spread from min to max.
Which chart helps detect clusters and patterns?,Line chart|Pie chart|Scatter plot|Box plot,2,Scatter plots can reveal clusters and patterns.
What does missing completely at random (MCAR) imply?,Depends on a variable|Unrelated to any variable|Due to data entry|Caused by outliers,1,MCAR means missingness is independent of data.
"When exploring text data, which quick measure is useful?",Word count|Variance|IQR|Correlation,0,Word count indicates length or verbosity of text.
Which visual compares multiple categories over time?,Stacked bar chart|Pie chart|Box plot|Scatter plot,0,Stacked bars show category parts across time.
Which statistic is robust to outliers?,Mean|Median|Variance|Standard deviation,1,Median is less influenced by extreme values.
What does a heatmap commonly display in exploration?,Raw images|Correlation matrix|Audio levels|Text paragraphs,1,Heatmaps visualize correlations between variables.
What is standard deviation?,Square of mean|Square root of variance|Median minus mean|Maximum minus minimum,1,"It is the square root of variance, showing spread."
Which first step is typical in EDA?,Choose model|Plot graphs and compute summaries|Deploy app|Write report,1,EDA begins with summaries and visualizations.
"If data is right-skewed, which is true?",Mean < Median|Mean > Median|Mean = Median|No relation,1,Right skew pulls the mean to the right (larger).
